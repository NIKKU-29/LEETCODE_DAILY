
# Intuitive Approach and Explanation:

The goal of the code is to maximize the points ( point ) by processing a string  s  based on two types of operations ( x  and  y ). The operations prioritize certain character pairs ( ab  or  ba ) depending on their associated points ( x  for  ab  and  y  for  ba ).

 Key Steps: 

1.  Stack Usage : 
   - Two stacks ( a  and  b ) are used to manage characters based on their priority pairs ( ab  or  ba ).
   - Stack  a  initially processes the string  s  based on the priority set by  x  and  y .
   
2.  Priority Handling :
   - Depending on whether  x  is less than  y , the algorithm prioritizes processing either  ba  or  ab .
   - This ensures that higher point-gaining pairs are processed first.

3.  Processing Loop :
   - As it iterates through each character in  s , it checks against the top of stack  a  to determine if a pair ( ab  or  ba ) can be formed.
   - If a pair is formed, points ( x  or  y ) are added to  point  and the corresponding stack ( a  or  b ) is popped.
   - If no pair is formed, the character is pushed onto stack  a .

4.  Handling Remaining Characters :
   - After processing the string  s , any remaining characters in stack  a  are transferred to stack  b .
   - Stack  b  is then processed to handle any remaining pairs ( ab  or  ba ), adding the respective points to  point .

 Complexity Analysis: 

-  Time Complexity : 
  -  O(n) , where  n  is the length of string  s .
  - Each character is processed a constant number of times (pushed and popped at most twice across both stacks).

-  Space Complexity : 
  -  O(n) , where  n  is the length of string  s .
  - Space is primarily used by stacks  a  and  b , which can grow up to the length of  s  in the worst case.

 Intuition :
- By using stacks to manage and prioritize character pairs ( ab  or  ba ), the algorithm ensures that it maximizes points by first handling pairs that yield higher points ( x  or  y ).
- It efficiently processes the string in a single pass ( O(n)  complexity), using additional space proportional to the input size to maintain and process character stacks.
