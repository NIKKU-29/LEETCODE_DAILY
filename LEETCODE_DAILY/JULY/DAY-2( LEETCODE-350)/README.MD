### Approach using Sorting

 Intuition:  Sorting both arrays allows efficient comparison of elements.

 Steps: 
1.  Sorting:  Sort  nums1  and  nums2  to facilitate comparison.
2.  Two Pointers:  Use two pointers ( i  for  nums1  and  j  for  nums2 ) to traverse through the sorted arrays.
3.  Comparison:  Compare elements pointed by  i  and  j . 
   - If they are equal, add the element to the result and move both pointers forward.
   - If  nums1[i]  is less than  nums2[j] , move  i  forward.
   - Otherwise, move  j  forward.
4.  Result Collection:  Store common elements in a result vector  ans .
5.  Termination:  Stop when either pointer reaches the end of its respective array.

 Time Complexity:  Sorting each array takes  (O(n  log n + m  log m) ), where  (n ) and  (m ) are the lengths of  nums1  and  nums2  respectively. Traversal with two pointers takes  (O(n + m) ). Overall, the time complexity is  (O(n  log n + m  log m) ).

 Space Complexity:  Constant space  (O(1) ) for pointers and variables,  (O(k) ) for  ans  where  (k ) is the number of common elements.

### Approach using Hash Map for Element Counts

 Intuition:  Use a hash map to count occurrences of each element in  nums1 , then iterate through  nums2  to find common elements.

 Steps: 
1.  Hash Map:  Build a hash map ( store ) to count occurrences of each element in  nums1 .
2.  Intersection:  Iterate through  nums2 . If an element exists in  store  with a positive count, add it to  ans  and decrement its count in  store .
3.  Avoid Duplicates:  Ensure each common element is added only once by decrementing its count in  store .
4.  Result:  Return  ans , containing all elements present in both arrays.

 Time Complexity:  Building the hash map from  nums1  takes  (O(n) ). Checking elements in  nums2  against  store  takes  (O(m) ). Overall, the time complexity is  (O(n + m) ).

 Space Complexity:   (O(n) ) for  store  and  (O( min(n, m)) ) for  ans .

By utilizing these approaches, you can efficiently find and return the intersection of elements between  nums1  and  nums2 , optimizing both time and space complexities based on the characteristics of the problem and your programming needs.
