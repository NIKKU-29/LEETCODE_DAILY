Alright, imagine we're cleaning up a messy room full of folders and files using this code. üßπ Here's the story:

Intuition:
We start with a clean room (depth = 0). As we go through each command in logs, we're either moving up a level ("../"), staying in the same place ("./"), or going deeper into a folder (any other string).

Approach:

Up a level ("../"): If we're not already at the root (depth != 0), we can move one level up by reducing our depth. If we're already at the root (depth = 0), we can't go higher, so we skip this command.

Stay here ("./"): No action needed, just continue with the next command.

Go deeper (folder name): Increase our depth because we're going into a new folder.

Time Complexity:
The code runs through each command (elem) in logs exactly once, so it's O(n), where n is the number of commands in logs.

Space Complexity:
We only use a constant amount of extra space (O(1)), regardless of how big logs is, because we're just keeping track of depth.

So, the room starts clean (depth = 0), and after processing all the commands, depth tells us how deep we've gone into the folders. üìÅ
