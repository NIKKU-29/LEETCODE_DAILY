### Problem Intuition and Approach:

The problem asks you to take a 1D vector (`original`) and reshape it into a 2D vector with `m` rows and `n` columns. If it's impossible to reshape the vector (i.e., if the size of `original` is not exactly `m * n`), the function should return an empty 2D vector.

#### Approach:
1. **Check Validity**: First, check if the product of `m` and `n` matches the size of the `original` vector. If not, return an empty vector because it's impossible to reshape it to the required dimensions.
2. **Reshaping Process**: 
   - Create a 2D vector `ans` to store the reshaped result.
   - Use two nested loops: 
     - The outer loop iterates `m` times (for the rows).
     - The inner loop iterates `n` times (for the columns).
   - For each position in the 2D vector, push elements from the `original` vector sequentially into the current row.
3. **Return Result**: Once all elements are placed into the `2D` vector, return the `ans` vector.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**: 
  - The time complexity is directly proportional to the size of the 2D array (`m * n`), as every element in the `original` vector is visited exactly once to be placed into the 2D vector.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(m * n)**:
  - The space complexity is also proportional to the size of the 2D array (`m * n`), as a new 2D vector of the same size is created to store the reshaped elements.

### Summary:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)` because every element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` because we are creating a 2D vector to store the result.
