### **Problem Understanding:**

You have `n` students standing in a row, each with a certain amount of chalk. The students take turns using the chalk in a round-robin fashion until the chalk runs out. The task is to find the index of the student who will be the next to use the chalk when the supply runs out.

### **Approach and Intuition:**

1. **Sum the Chalk Used in One Complete Cycle:**
   - First, calculate the total amount of chalk used by all the students in one complete round. This is done by summing up all elements in the `chalk` array.
   - Let's denote this total as `chalkUsedInOneCycle`.

2. **Optimize the Remaining Chalk:**
   - Instead of simulating every use of chalk, which could be inefficient, we can directly reduce the number of chalk pieces `k` by the total chalk used in a full cycle. This is done using the modulo operation: `k % chalkUsedInOneCycle`. This gives us the remaining chalk after completing as many full cycles as possible.

3. **Find the Student Who Uses the Remaining Chalk:**
   - Starting from the first student, subtract each student's chalk usage from the remaining chalk (`number`). The first time `number` becomes less than the current student's chalk requirement, that student is the one who will be using the last piece of chalk.

4. **Return the Index:**
   - The index of the student is returned as the result.

### **Time Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Summing the Chalk (First Loop):** 
   - Calculating the total chalk used in one cycle requires iterating through the `chalk` array once, which has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of students.

2. **Finding the Student (Second Loop):**
   - After reducing `k`, you iterate through the `chalk` array again to find the student who will use the last piece of chalk. This also has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - Since both loops run sequentially, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### **Space Complexity Analysis:**

1. **Extra Space Used:**
   - The algorithm uses a few extra variables: `chalkUsedInOneCycle`, `number`, and `index`. All of these require \(O(1)\) space.

2. **No Additional Data Structures:**
   - The solution does not require any additional data structures beyond the input array, so no extra space is used.

3. **Overall Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since no extra space is used that scales with the input size.

### **Summary:**

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of students.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
