### Intuition

The problem is to compute the minimum number of key presses required to type a given word on a keyboard where each key can have a different number of letters assigned to it. The approach involves:

1. **Frequency Calculation:** Count the frequency of each character in the given word.
2. **Sorting Frequencies:** Sort these frequencies in descending order.
3. **Assigning Multipliers:** Assign multipliers to the characters based on their sorted frequency:
   - The first 8 most frequent characters require 1 press each.
   - The next 8 characters require 2 presses each, and so on.
4. **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the total key presses required by multiplying the frequency of each character by its corresponding multiplier.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:**

1. **Calculating Frequencies:** This takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the word, as we need to iterate through each character in the word.
2. **Sorting Frequencies:** Sorting the fixed 26 characters takes \(O(26 \log 26)\), which simplifies to \(O(1)\) since 26 is a constant.
3. **Summing Key Presses:** Iterating through the 26 possible characters to calculate the total presses takes \(O(26)\), which is also \(O(1)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we use a fixed amount of extra space, namely an array of size 26 to store the frequencies.

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Calculation:** We iterate through the word to count the frequency of each character and store it in the `freq` array.
2. **Sorting:** We sort the `freq` array in descending order to prioritize the most frequent characters.
3. **Key Press Calculation:** We iterate through the sorted frequencies and calculate the total key presses using the multiplier logic.
4. **Return Result:** Finally, we return the total sum representing the minimum number of key presses required.
